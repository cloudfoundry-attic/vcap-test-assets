This app was originally created using the 'grails' shell. Subsequently, it was
'maven-ised' so as to result in a canonical way to build / clean the app. The
'pom.xml' was generated by invoking "mvn org.grails:grails-maven-plugin:1.3.7:create-pom -DgroupId=org.cloudfoundry"
To build the Grails guestbook application:
1. cd into the root directory of the app (the directory where this README is).
2. Invoke the grails shell command "grails clean" followed by "grails war"
2'. Alternately you can invoked "mvn clean package"
3. The resulting war should be in the target directory.
